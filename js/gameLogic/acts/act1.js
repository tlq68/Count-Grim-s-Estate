        "As Rupert Evers approaches the sign, his tall, shadowy figure casts elongated silhouettes upon the ground, blending with the encroaching dusk.~-CONT- \"Welcome to the haunted mansion, where darkness lurks behind every corner and secrets whisper through the halls,\" the sign declares ominously. \n\tHe scoffs internally at the notion of a haunted mansion, dismissing it as nothing more than a fantastical tale spun to frighten the gullible. After all, Rupert doesn't believe in the supernatural. Yet, despite his rational skepticism, there's an undeniable pull, a magnetic force that draws him closer to the sign despite his reservations. The mansion itself looms over him like a brooding sentinel, its once-grand facade now weathered by the passage of time and neglect. It seems alive with stories untold, each window a watchful eye casting silent judgment upon those who dare to trespass. Darkness seeps from the mansion's very pores, an oppressive weight that hangs heavy in the air, causing Rupert to shiver involuntarily. Despite himself, however, he feels a thrill of anticipation tingling in his veins. Perhaps it's the challenge of unraveling the mysteries within, or maybe it's just sheer curiosity that has brought him to this place. Whatever the reason, Rupert finds himself inexorably drawn to the foreboding entrance of the mansion, his steps guided by an insatiable desire to confront whatever lies beyond its shadowy threshold.."

His knuckles rap against the weathered surface, the sound echoing eerily through the silence. For a moment, there is no response, only the haunting creak of old wood in the stillness of the night. Just as Rupert begins to doubt his actions, the door creaks open slowly, revealing a dimly lit foyer beyond. A chill runs down his spine as he hesitates, unsure of what awaits him on the other side. Should he venture inside and confront the mysteries within, or retreat from the unknown?."

Intrigued, he steps closer, his footsteps muffled by the overgrown grass underfoot. The wood in question seems almost out of place, its surface smooth and untouched by time or weather. A sense of unease washes over Rupert as he examines the anomaly. It's as if this particular section of the mansion is trying to hide something, a secret concealed beneath its seemingly perfect exterior. The hairs on the back of his neck prickle, a subtle warning that there's more to this discovery than meets the eye. With a mixture of curiosity and caution, Rupert reaches out to touch the suspiciously flawless wood, half expecting it to give way like a facade in a stage play, revealing the true nature of what lies beneath. His fingers linger on the surface, hesitating before making contact, unsure of what he might uncover with this seemingly innocuous gesture. Should he delve deeper into this mystery, risking what truths may be lurking beneath the surface? Or is it wiser to step back and continue his exploration of the mansion through more conventional means?
